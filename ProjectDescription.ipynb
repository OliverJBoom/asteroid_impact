    "## Synopsis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. The fate of an asteroid is a complex function of its initial mass, speed, trajectory angle and internal strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid) 10-100 m in diameter can penetrate deep into Earth’s atmosphere and disrupt catastrophically, generating an atmospheric disturbance ([airburst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst)) that can cause [damage on the ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo). Such an event occurred over the city of [Chelyabinsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor) in Russia, in 2013, injuring thousands of people ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642); [Brown et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12741)). An even larger event occurred over [Tunguska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event), an unpopulated area in Siberia, in 1908. \n",

    "## Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of an asteroid in Earth’s atmosphere prior to break-up is governed by a coupled set of ordinary differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{aligned} \n",
    "\\frac{dv}{dt} & = \\frac{-C_D\\rho_a A v^2}{2 m} + g \\sin \\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dm}{dt} & = \\frac{-C_H\\rho_a A v^3}{2 Q} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} & = \\frac{g\\cos\\theta}{v} - \\frac{C_L\\rho_a A v}{2 m} - \\frac{v\\cos\\theta}{R_P + z} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} & = -v\\sin\\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} & = \\frac{v\\cos\\theta}{1 + z/R_P}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\n",
    "In these equations,$v$, $m$, and $A$ are the asteroid velocity, mass and cross-sectional area, respectively; $\\theta$ is the meteoroid trajectory angle to the surface, $x$ is the downrange distance of the meteoroid from its entry position, $z$ is the altitude and $t$ is time; $C_D$ is the drag coefficient, $\\rho_a$ is the atmospheric density (a function of altitude ), $C_H$ is an ablation efficiency coefficient, $Q$ is the specific heat of ablation; $C_L$ is a lift coefficient; and $R_P$ is the planetary radius. All terms use MKS units.\n"

    "A commonly used criterion for the break-up of an asteroid in the atmosphere is when the ram pressure of the air interacting with the asteroid $\\rho_a v^2$ first exceeds the strength of the asteroid $\\sigma_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_a v^2 = \\sigma_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Should break-up occur, the asteroid deforms and spreads laterally as it continues its passage through the atmosphere. Several models for the spreading rate have been proposed. In the simplest model, the fragmented asteroid’s spreading rate is related to its along trajectory speed [(Hills and Goda, 1993)](http://doi.org/10.1086/116499):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\left[\\frac{7}{2}\\alpha\\frac{\\rho_a}{\\rho_m}\\right]^{1/2} v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r$ is the asteroid radius, $\\rho_m$ is the asteroid density and $\\alpha$ is a spreading coefficient, often taken to be 0.3. It is conventional to define the cross-sectional area of the expanding cloud of fragments as $A = \\pi r^2$, for use in the above equations.\n"

    "The figure below shows a typical solution to the above set of equations for an impact airburst scenario. The kinetic energy loss per km, which is a good approximation for the energy transferred to the atmosphere as heat (and is often referred to as the energy deposited per km), is shown as a function of altitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/airburst.png\" width=\"640\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario the asteroid experiences breakup at approximately 48-km altitude, before spreading and decelerating rapidly until an altitude of 15 km at which point the **peak energy loss per km is maximum**. This point is often considered to be the **burst altitude**. The total kinetic energy lost by the asteroid at this point is a good estimate of the airburst energy (i.e., the total energy deposited into the atmosphere) for hazard analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude well (>5 km) above the surface can be considered to be airburst events and are unlikely to form a sizable crater on the ground. In such cases, even if a substantial fraction of the original asteroid survives to the ground it will be decelerated to a very small fraction of its initial speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact scenarios with a burst altitude below the surface (i.e., peak energy deposition per km is not reached before the asteroid strikes the ground) will form a sizable impact crater on the ground and can be considered as a cratering event (although a sizable proportion of the original kinetic energy of the asteroid may be transferred to the air).\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these scenarios is a complex regime where a low altitude airburst combined with a substantial crater-forming event is likely. This regime is not well understood.\n"

Up to 5 marks (each) will be awarded for completion of each optional task, capped at 10 marks. Marks will be deducted for (a) inaccuracy in the solution; (b) bugs or mistakes in implementation; (c) gross inefficiency (i.e., code efficiency is not an important aspect of this project, but very slow code will be penalised).\n",
