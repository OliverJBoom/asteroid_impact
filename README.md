# Armageddon - Atmospheric entry and disruption of asteroids

## Synopsis:

Asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are subject to extreme drag forces that decelerate, heat and disrupt the space rocks. The fate of an asteroid is a complex function of its initial mass, speed, trajectory angle and internal strength. 

Asteroids 10-100 m in diameter can penetrate deep into Earth’s atmosphere and disrupt catastrophically, generating an atmospheric disturbance that can cause damage on the ground. Such an event occurred over the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, in 2013, injuring thousands of people ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642); [Brown et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1038/nature12741)). An even larger event occurred over Tunguska, an unpopulated area in Siberia, in 1908. 

The purpose of this is to develop a fast numerical simulator to predict the fate of asteroids entering Earth’s atmosphere for the purposes of hazard assessment.
