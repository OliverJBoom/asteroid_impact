Choice of numerical scheme for atmosphiric scale height

Choice of ODE solving scheme

Have chosen spherical for calculation of mass, but have used circle for
drag coefficient. 


Mars data decisions
difference in 
density at sea level, gravity, radius of mars, astmospheric scale height

density at sea level = 0.02 kg/m^3        # https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html
gravity = 0.38 * g_E                      # http://planetary-science.org/mars-research/martian-atmosphere/
radius = 3396e3 m                         # https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html
atsmopheric scale height = 11.1 e3        # https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html
heat transfer coefficient                 # does change due to the chemistry but can assume constant
heat of ablation constant                 # does change but can assume constant
