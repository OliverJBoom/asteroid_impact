10:45 - 12:00

All team present  

What was discussed
Going through project goal sheet
Selecting questions for 12:00 meeting
Choosing initial variable values
How to layout the code, each function having one use and run through main
Licensing clarification

To Do -
Asign the academic papers to each person
Find out how Travis works
Choose ODE solver
Find out the minimum deflection angle
Calculating the rate change of gravity


Questions for Gareth - 
Density of the asteroids
Can we get access to the slides - also having access to the recording
Reentry corridor limits. At what angle will it bounce off of the earth
How are we quantifying the energy loss. Is it just KE loss
Does do we model Cd change. Is Cd constant
How are we modelling the geometric change of the asteroid
What is the minimum deflection angle
Should we include the rate change of gravity
How to get the values for atmospheric scale height
Is burst altitude just the altitude where stresses exceed the yield stress
Is sigma_0 called yield strength
Do we need to take into account the shock wave
Is heat ablation constant constant (lol)
Is it 3d -this would affect astroid geometry and also curvature of the earth
Did Gareth mention something about licensing the software
