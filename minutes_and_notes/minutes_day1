10:45 - 12:00

All team present  

What was discussed
Going through project goal sheet
Selecting questions for 12:00 meeting
Choosing initial variable values
How to layout the code, each function having one use and run through main
Licensing clarification

To Do -
Asign the academic papers to each person
Find out how Travis works
Choose ODE solver
Find out the minimum deflection angle
Calculating the rate change of gravity


Questions for Gareth - 
Density of the asteroids
- Will be given a paper giving the distributuion of the input parameters

Can we get access to the slides - also having access to the recording
- Yes will be made available
How is software tested
- Tested by humans with instruction
Influence of lift on angle of enterance
- Will be very small. Should still be looked into
Reentry corridor limits. At what angle will it bounce off of the earth
- Work out the limits outselved. But from 0 degrees to 90 will
need to be calcualted
How are we quantifying the energy loss. Is it just KE loss
- Very naunced transfers between energy types. Only want to record
the loss of KE and assume that is deposited into the atmosphere
Does do we model Cd change. Is Cd constant
- Coefficient are taken as constant 
How are we modelling the geometric change of the asteroid
- Cross sectional area is the only thing of interest. Because Cd
is taken to be 1 so not a problem. 
Should we include the rate change of gravity
- Gravity is taken to be constant
How to get the values for atmospheric scale height
- Given table and have to interpolate between them. Will need 
interpolation skills from ACSE-3
Range of asteroid size
- 1 micron to size of Mars. Think about the 3m rock analogy and the
relevant implications.
Is burst altitude just the altitude where stresses exceed the yield stress
- Breakup altitude is where the stresses exceed the yield stress. 
Bust is maximum deceleration.
Is sigma_0 called yield strength
- Its an input parameter. Is the asteroid tensile strength. Can use range
of infered tensile strength of asteroids. Also called bulk strength.
Do we need to take into account the shock wave
- No modelling of shockwaves.
Is heat ablation constant constant (lol)
- Taken as constant. SI units. 
Is it 3d -this would affect astroid geometry and also curvature of the earth
- Taken to be a circular with the radius of the earth 
Did Gareth mention something about licensing the software
- Pick a license. Just about going through the process of picking a license.

Clarification of points by Gareth
- rho0 is taken to be 1.2kg (the density of air at sea level.)
- when calcualting the energy lost per unit height it should always
be calculated for altitude not from the path length.
