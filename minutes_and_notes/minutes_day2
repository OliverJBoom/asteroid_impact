All team present

ODE solver, not broken as before but not correct. 
Fractmentation was turned off because its not working. 

Creating analytical solution for comparison with tests

Aim for today-
Fix the program without burst alttiude
Implement burst altitude 

Mike - Creating tests
Laura - Fixing ODE to give correct results
Ollie - Implementing compulsorary functionality
        Looking into whether inbuilt functionality
        for peicewise ODE solver
Hameed - Implementing analytical solution
Sanaz - Begin Jupyter Notebook

Potential other tasks 
- Find good boundary case values
- Research standard values for asteroid strength etc. 
- How to switch between constant radius and expanding 
when the tensile strength is exceeeded. Either look into
whether there is inbuilt functionality within the Scipy 
function. Or can run once, find the point where the 
tensile strength is exceeded and then rerun the solver
from that point using indexing. 
- Before the burst occurs how can the asteroid keep the
same radius and still lose mass at the same rate as before.
The mass change should be zero prior to burst.

Questions for Gareth
- Should we make a crater? When should we stop
- Need to know what the situation is regarding mass
prior to burst
