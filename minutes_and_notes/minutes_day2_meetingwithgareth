Meeting with Gareth on Day 2 

- If we consider the asteroid to be a cylinder, the unchanging density and radius when mass is decreased due to ablation makes sense.
  - It's up to us if we want to use a sphere instead but we should justify what we do 
  - The results will be different to theirs if we do but the code is not automatically tested

- Confirmed we are not looking at potential energy
- v is always measured along axis of motion so it's kind of like "speed"

- Github project management:
  - Might be useful to take a look at "milestones" and the "issue tracker"
  - Never push to master, everyone should have their own branches
  - Perform pull requests when you add changes to the master branch
