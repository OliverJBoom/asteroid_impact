Meeting Day 3

All team members present

Values are off for solutions using improved Euler
Could be either method, underlying equations or wrong inputs
- Wrong method - could try solve_ivp again. But unlikely to 
be so far out
- Underlying equations - have been checked regularly but
could recheck
- Wrong inputs - Go over known test cases to see if actually out

What are actually out by?
- Kinetic energy - factor of 2 - 200 depending on initial case
- Burst altitude - actually looks correctish

Want to put in case for Cherybynsk to see how far out the
different factors are

Analytical solution 
- Shape correct but out by a factor of 1e7

Tasks 
Mike - Go and recreate Cherybynsk using exact data then
compare with our solutions
Hamed - Rework analytical solution to find out factor out by
Ollie - Go and try and redo solve_ivp using Mikes latest code
Sanaz - Pair with Hamed to go through analytical solution
