Apply your software to determine the impactor parameters (asteroid size & strength) for the Chelyabinsk airburst, by fitting your model solutions of kinetic energy loss per km vs. altitude to the inferred energy deposition curve (available [here](data/ChelyabinskEnergyAltitude.csv)). Note that in this data file energy is given in units of [kilotons of TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent), where 1 kt TNT is equivalent to $4.184 \\times 10^{12}$ J. Note also that the density 3300 kg/m$^3$, impact angle (18.3 degrees to horizontal) and entry velocity (19.2 km/s) are well known from observations ([Popova et al., 2013](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642)).
